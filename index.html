		PRESENT USED VERSION OF HTML IS VERSION 5 ( HTML5 )<br>
		Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
		Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br>
		HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.<br><br>

            HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.<br>
            Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.

          	<b>December 18, 1997</b><br>
            HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:<br>
            Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden<br>
            Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed<br>
            Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.<br>
            Initially code-named "Cougar",HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.<br>
            <b>April 24, 1998</b><br>
            HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.<br>
            December 24, 1999
            HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.<br>
            <b>May 2000</b><br>
            ISO/IEC 15445:2000("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).<br>
            After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.<br>

		PRESENT USED VERSION OF CSS IS VERSION 3 ( CSS3 )<br>
     Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>

     CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br>
     The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br><br>

		<ul>
          <li class="listi">CSS1</li>
          <p class="sideinfo">
          	 The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published on December 17, 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos are credited as the original developers. Among its capabilities are support for:-<br>

             Font properties such as typeface and emphasis<br>
             Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements<br>
             Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text<br>
             Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements<br>
             Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements<br>
             Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes<br>
             The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.<br>
          </p>
          <li class="listi">CSS2</li>
          <p class="sideinfo">
          	CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998. A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which were later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules)and bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows.<br>

             The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 2 recommendation.
          </p>
          <li class="listi">CSS2.1</li>
          <p class="sideinfo">
          	CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specification. To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but it was reverted to a Working Draft on June 13, 2005 for further review. It returned to Candidate Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated twice in 2009. However, because changes and clarifications were made, it again went back to Last Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010.<br>

            CSS 2.1 went to Proposed Recommendation on 12 April 2011.After being reviewed by the W3C Advisory Committee, it was finally published as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2011.<br>

            CSS 2.1 was planned as the first and final revision of level 2—but low priority work on CSS 2.2 began in 2015.

<h3><b>JS</b></h3>
     <p class="para">
		<b class="sidehead"> JS : </b><br><br>
		    JavaScript,often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, 
	     often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class 
	     functions.<br> Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages 
	     and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a 
	     dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.<br> As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
	     It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). 
	     However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment 
	     (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.<br> JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, 
	     usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.<br>
	     Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, 
	     the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.<br>
